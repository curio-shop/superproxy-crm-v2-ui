# Git Workflow

**CRITICAL: Always ask for approval before committing changes to the repository.**

## Workflow Steps

1. **Make Changes**: Implement the requested features, fixes, or updates
2. **Show Changes**: Explain what was changed and why
3. **Ask for Approval**: Wait for explicit user confirmation before committing
4. **Commit Only When Approved**: Do not commit until the user explicitly approves
5. **Push Only When Requested**: Only push to remote when user explicitly asks

## Rules

❌ **NEVER automatically commit** after making changes  
❌ **NEVER automatically push** after committing  
❌ **NEVER assume** the user wants to keep the changes  

✅ **ALWAYS ask** "Would you like to commit these changes?"  
✅ **ALWAYS wait** for explicit approval before running `git commit`  
✅ **ALWAYS batch** related changes into logical commits when approved  

## Example Flow

```
User: "Add second Filipino voice"
Assistant: [makes changes]
Assistant: "I've added Maria as the second Filipino voice and removed Zofia from Polish. Would you like to commit these changes?"
User: "Yes" or "Execute"
Assistant: [commits with meaningful message]
```

## Benefits

- User maintains full control over git history
- Allows review before changes are permanent
- Enables batching multiple changes into logical commits
- Prevents cluttered git history with incremental commits
- User decides what actually makes it to the repository
